# mathematical operators

# addition
# - when both the operands are of numeric type
print(f"10 + 20 = {10 + 20}")

# subtraction
print(f"10 - 20 = {10 - 20}")

# multiplication
# - when the operands are of numeric data type (int or float)
print(f"10 * 20 = {10 * 20}")

# this is called as real division operation
print(f"10 / 20 = {10 / 20}")

# this is called as floor division operation
print(f"10 // 20 = {10 // 20}")

# this is called as exponential operation
# get the 3rd power of 10 => 10 * 10 * 10
print(f"10 ** 3 = {10 ** 3}")

# this is called as modulo operation
# - this will return the remainder of division operation
print(f"10 % 3 = {10 % 3}")

# repetition operation
# - when first operand is string and second operand is int
print("-" * 10)
print("-*-" * 10)
print("hello" * 10)

print(f"'hello' + ' ' + 'world' = {'hello' + ' ' + 'world'}")
